## **Dataset Explanation 📊**  
The dataset includes the following key attributes:  

- **Species:** The wildlife species being monitored.  
- **Population Count:** The estimated number of individuals per species.  
- **Conservation Status:** Classification of species as **Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable**.  
- **Threat Factors:** Impact from **climate change, poaching, human activities, habitat destruction, and disease**.  
- **Human Settlements:** Number of **human settlements** within a 10 km range of species habitat.  
- **Mortality Rate:** Percentage of individuals that do not survive in a given year.  
- **Average Lifespan:** Estimated **years a species lives** in the wild.

## **Key Visualizations & Insights 🏞️**  

### **1️⃣ Population by Species 📈**  
- **Chart Type:** Horizontal Bar Chart  
- **Insights:** Displays the population size of different species.  
- **Observation:** The **Indian Gaur, Red Panda, and Blackbuck** have relatively higher populations, whereas the **Asiatic Lion and Snow Leopard** have much lower numbers.  

### **2️⃣ Threats Impact on Top 4 Species 🚨**  
- **Chart Type:** Stacked Bar Chart  
- **Insights:** Shows **various threats** (Climate Change, Disease, Habitat Loss, Poaching, Human Interference) affecting major species.  
- **Observation:** Habitat destruction and human activities pose the most significant threats across species.  

### **3️⃣ Gender Ratio by Species 🚻**  
- **Chart Type:** Donut Chart  
- **Insights:** Illustrates the gender distribution across species.  
- **Observation:** Some species show a near-balanced ratio, while others have **gender imbalances**, which could impact breeding and conservation efforts.  

### **4️⃣ Human Impact vs. Mortality Rate of Wildlife Species 🏠⚰️**  
- **Chart Type:** Scatter Plot  
- **X-Axis:** Average Human Settlements (within 10km)  
- **Y-Axis:** Average Mortality Rate  
- **Insights:** This chart highlights how **increasing human settlements lead to higher wildlife mortality rates**.  
- **Observation:** The **One-horned Rhinoceros** and **Bengal Tiger** show **high mortality rates** in areas with human interference.  

### **5️⃣ Species Distribution Across Regions 🌍**  
- **Chart Type:** Map Visualization  
- **Insights:** Shows the **geographical distribution** of species and their conservation status.  
- **Observation:** Critically endangered species are concentrated in certain regions, requiring **targeted conservation efforts**.  

### **6️⃣ Average Mortality Rate of Wildlife Species 💀**  
- **Chart Type:** Bar Chart  
- **Insights:** Displays the **species with the highest mortality rates**.  
- **Observation:** The **One-horned Rhinoceros** has the highest mortality rate (11%), followed by the **Bengal Tiger and Indian Elephant** (10%).  

### **7️⃣ Average Lifespan of Wildlife Species ⏳**  
- **Chart Type:** Bar Chart  
- **Insights:** Compares the **lifespan of different species**.  
- **Observation:** Species with **shorter lifespans tend to reproduce faster**, while long-lived species like **elephants and rhinos** are more vulnerable due to slower reproduction rates.
